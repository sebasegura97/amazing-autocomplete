# General notes and thoughts

1. I’m assuming that asking for avoid 3rd party libraries is for prevent extra help in the React component building process (like using some autocomplete library) but the project initialization and configuration is not what you are caring about right now, so i’ll take a shortcut with next.js to show you better my skills on a day to day coding task. 

2. Choosen API: [https://docs.coincap.io/](https://docs.coincap.io/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
